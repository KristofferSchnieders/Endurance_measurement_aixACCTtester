Project for endurance measurements. 

For measuring the script Endurance_MeasurementScript has to be run. 
In this main script the functions from the functions folder are used. 
In the function folder 4 scripts can be found: 
    1. algo_management: Functions for managing the algorithm (what to do when)
    2. data_management: Functions for managing the data (What to put where)
    3. wafermap_Neurotech1: Information about the measured structure (What we measure)
    4. waveforms_cassini: Preparation of measurement (What we want to do)
